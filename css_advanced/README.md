# CSS Advanced

This project builds on the **HTML, Advanced** project and focuses on applying structured and modern **CSS styling** to recreate a pixel-perfect webpage from a Figma design.

The goal is to take the raw HTML structure and style it using pure **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (no frameworks, no external libraries).

## 🎨 Figma Design
We are required to build the website based on the official ALX Figma design.

**Figma link:**  
(Insert your Figma file link here)

**FIG file download:**  
(Insert .fig file link here)

If the fonts used in the design are not available on your system, download:  
- Source Sans Pro  
- Spin Cycle OT  

Some values on Figma may be in decimals — rounding them to whole numbers is acceptable.
